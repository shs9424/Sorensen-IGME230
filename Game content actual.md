Star Racer: A game about aliens, planets, and racing
======
*A game concept written by Sam Sorensen*

## I. The High Concept of Star Racer

In short, it's a strategic racing game that's more about building and customizing your racer than the racing itself.

## II. The Genre of Star Racer

Genre, as we all know, is a bit fluid and hard to pin down , but Star Racer classically fits as a strategy game, though there are light racing elements as well.

## III. The Platform of Star Racer

Star Racer will be available on desktop browser, and ideally will be ported to mobile devices as well.

## IV. The Story of Star Racer

You are a newly arrived racer to the Zerigox System, where the Intergalactic Planet Races are held. You are here to work your way up the lists of racers, and eventually take on the Intergalactic Champion and win the title for yourself.

You need to upgrade your car, master the tracks, learn your opponents, and more to win the races and best the Champion.

## V. The Aesthetics of Star Racer

### The Visuals

The game has a bright, simple aesthetic, reminiscient of classic Saturday Morning cartoons. 

The player will typically know at least a few of these elements going into a race, but they need to be able to quickly know their opponent, their opponent's car, any distinctive features of the racer, the planet, and any other effects happening, ideally with no more than a glance.

Given this, each alien, planet, and car will need to have a distinctive visual design. The aliens and cars will be especially colorful, with the planets reserved for more muted hues so as not to over-clutter the screen.

### The Sounds

The sound design of the game is relatively simple, primarily focusing on slightly retro space sound effects, and some light electronic background music.

Each car should have a slightly varying sound, ideally being able to alter slightly with engine types. For instance, if the Aetherwing XI car makes a soft clicking sound, a more powerful engine would have the clicking occur slightly faster than a weaker engine. Similarly, each planet will have its own background effects, ones that can serve as audible cues in the event of a track changing unexpectedly.

Each alien type will likely have about three unique sound effect "voice lines" they can make when introducing themselves to a potential opponent (the player), further reinforcing the alien variety and ease of use for the player. 

## VI. The Gameplay of Star Racer

There are three distinct modes of play in Star Racer: the garage, the cages, and the track.

### The Garage

In the player's garage, they can customize and alter their cars. Each car has several parts:

 - Chassis
 
 - Engine
 
 - Wheels (or replacement, like hover tech)
 
 - Fuel
 
 - Armor
 
 - Control (comprising everything from a simple steering wheel to neuro-fibre connectors)
 
 - Weapons
 
 - Special abilities (like jumping, flying, phasing, etc.)
 
Each of these costs credits, of which the player can only earn through winning races. Some parts, like fuel, must be bought after each race. Other parts, like engines, wear out regularly and need to be repaired. Others, like armor, wear directly in proportion to player use, i.e. if a player crashes their car frequently during one race, they will lose far more armor than if they drove more safely.

As the player progresses through the game, they will need to upgrade their car to compete with more difficult opponents. There will be a store that the player can purchase new parts from and sell their old parts to. However, the store's stock will vary, and their prices may change from day to day. Occasionally, a player may win parts from winning races, though they can lose parts just as easily this way.

### The Cages

The cages are where the player decides their race and opponent. The player must first choose from the planets of which they have access (as access to different planets in the Zerigox System costs a great deal of credits), then select a track on that planet, and then choose from the available racers on the planet.

The list of racers takes the form of a cycling list of headshots of opponents, a single shot of their car, and the racer's chosen bet. Bets are typically for credits, but occasionally may be for an entire car. The player can then scroll through the list of racers; if they accept a bet, the race begins immediately. 

As the player grows more powerful, weaker opponents are less likely to challenge the player--racers can recognize how powerful a player's car is, and won't race if they stand no chance of winnign.

### The Track

This is the actual racing part of the game. It takes place on a 2D track, with the opponent racing on the same track. Earlier tracks are smooth, low, and flat, making for easier racing, but later tracks are bumpy, with huge elevation differences, making for difficult racing.

Tracks also vary based on the planet they're on--some planets have natural dangers, like geysers, falling rocks, and pools of dangerous acids. These need to be avoided by the racers, or they risk their cars being destroyed.

Control is simple: the left and right arrow keys accelerate or decelerate the car, and the up and down keys control the pitch of the car. Three other keys--J, K, and L by default--control things like weapons and special abilities, though many cars do not have these.

While the controls are universal, individual cars drives differently, and the various customizations done also can control how the car controls and drives. Tweaking and modifying your car to your own personal tastes is an important task in Star Racer, as the most seemingly-powerful option is not necessarily the one that will allow you to race the best.

### Example Core Game Loop

The player, returning to their garage, resupplies on fuel and repairs any parts that need it. They browse through the shop, but are saving up for their next big upgrade, a new Steelbug Iridium Mesh armor cage.

They then head to the cages on Xalagar, the planet they purchased access to only a few races prior, where they scroll through 5 or 6 potential races before settling on a Verin racer in a Shadeblade Mk. 2, racing on the Scarlet Hills track. The bet is for 6500 credits, about half of the player's total.

Xalagar has occasional high winds, but the player's car has Dirtlubber Spiked Wheels, meaning that they can easily stay on track over the course's windy hills. While the Shadeblade is faster over flat terrain, the planet's natural dangers cause the Verin to be frequently blown backwards or upside down, and the player takes an easy victory.

The player then returns to their garage, with enough funds for their new armor upgrade, which they buy.

### Winning and Losing

If the player bests the Champion, they win the game.

This will take a while--the Champion's planet is prohibitively expensive to buy access to, and they have all of the best cars and parts. The player will need to work their through many planets and other races before taking on the Champion.

If the player at any point has lost their car and doesn't have the credits to purchase a new one, they are forfeit, and must leave the Zerigox System. 

Losing entirely in this way is unlikely, as there are often old and broken cars that can be bought for extremely cheap, but it is possible. The most likely scenario is if the player bets too high on a race, and then their car is destroyed on the track itself, leaving them with no car and no credits.
